First function named "gaborFilterBank.m" generates a custom-sized Gabor filter bank. It creates a u*v array, whose elements are m by n matrices; each matrix being a 2-D Gabor filter. 

Second function named "gaborFeatures.m" extracts the Gabor features of the image. It creates a column vector, consisting of the Gabor features of the input image. 

At the end of each file there is a Show section that plots the filters and shows the filtered images. These are only for illustration purpose, and you can comment them as you wish.
